HCI Project 4

This presents a repository of initial system design and introduction to our plans for our Google Assistant enabled health concierge application.

This shall entail the progress towards a working set of web application dashboards that can be opened via voice or text commands prompted by the Google Assistant.

The two main components are represented as the <strong>google-assistant-logic</strong> and the <strong>health-concierge-app</strong>. We also include in this initial repository the Google Assistant System Design Documentation for the reader to understand the workflow between interaction from <strong>USER</strong> to <strong>ASSISTANT</strong> to <strong>CONCIERGE</strong>. An updated proposal and project introduction is included as well.

The working copy of the health concierge app dashboard can be viewed here: http://rbu.ink/ which serves as an initial interface for the Google Assistant interactions for the dashboard, telemedicine services, and the pharmaceutical delivery.

Thank you,

Daniel Hwang, Judy Zhang, Ride Bu
